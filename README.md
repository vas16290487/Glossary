Descriptions of various programming concepts

## Algorithm

A set of instructions that a computer system may go through to solve a problem. Such an algorithm needs to have a well defined set of inputs and outputs. 

## Process of Building an Application

When building an application it is advised to use the following steps, in order to create a product that may effectively fulfil the requirements of a customer:

### Obtaining Requirements

The first when creating a software application, it is vital to contact the client and enquire about what the app is expected to do. After analysing the client's requests, a devloper would establish a set of requirements that this software would fulfil; the client's requests alone may be too ambigous to serve as a set of requirements.

### Design

This step as serves as the planning phase of a project. By this point, a devloper has an idea of what they want to achieve; next they need to establish the behaviour of the software and how it interacts with the user.

### Implementation

A developer would use the design documentation produced in the previous step in order to implement a software application. 

### Testing

During this step, a developer may test the functionality of the software application that they are working on. If the develoer chose an iterative software development lifecycle model, they may repeat the design, implementation and testing stages of the process until an adequate software application has been created. It should also be noted that some testing will be done during implementation in order to ensure that the software application that is being developed can be tested for issues that may not have been discovered during the design stage or the implementation stage.

### Deployment

At this point, a devoloper should be able to provide their client with a product that fits the client's expectations.

### Maintenance

Optionally, a developer may choose to support a finished software application for some period of time. This support could be in the form of updates for the application, that should reinforce the software's security and improve its functionality. 

## Programming Paradigms

### Procedural Programming

Procedural programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of calling functions. 

#### Function - 

#### Variables

### Object Orientated Programming

#### Objects

#### Classes

#### Methods

#### Properties

### Event Driven Programming

#### Events

#### Event Handling

### Similarities
